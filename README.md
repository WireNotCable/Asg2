## Design Process

### For E-Commerce Website:
We went with a simple lay-out to showcase the various features and products available on our store so that it is  easy and intuitive for users to find and access the services that they are looking for. As for the colour scheme, we decided to go with green, white & grey as we wanted to use colours that were calm & soothing for the eyes of our users. Moreover, the colour green is often associated with grocery stores. Therefore, we found it apt to use it as part of our colour scheme.

### For Fruits Slicer Game:
We went with a 2D (2-Dimensional) Pixelated game as we felt that it would be easy to design in a short frame of time. Moreover, upon testing out our game with various 2D and 3D layouts, we noticed that 2D pixelated images for the fruits seemed to fit well into the animation used for the explode function. Therefore, we went on to design our game completely in 2D pixel art.

### User Stories:
- As a new customer, I want to be able to navigate through the website easily to find the products I am looking for.
- As a regular customer, I want to receive some kind of promotion or offer to reduce the cost of my purchases.
